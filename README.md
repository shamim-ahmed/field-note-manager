field-note-manager
==================

This project focuses on creating a simple python web application for managing personal notes. Django framework is used as the basis of the web app.

In order to run the code, the following changes need to be made to settings.py :

1. 'STATIC_ROOT' needs to be set correctly
2. 'NAME' needs to be set correctly in 'DATABASES'
3. 'TEMPLATE_DIRS' needs to be set correctly

The default database comes with two user accounts : 'Diego/Diego' and 'Steve/Steve'
